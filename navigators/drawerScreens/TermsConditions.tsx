<TitleH2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</TitleH2>
<TitleDetails>Informal Negotiations</TitleDetails>
<AboutText>
To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a 
"Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the 
"Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) 
informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written 
notice from one Party to the other Party.
</AboutText>
<TitleDetails>Binding Arbitration</TitleDetails>
<AboutText>
If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly 
excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, 
YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the 
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary 
Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the American Arbitration 
Association (AAA) website. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA 
Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through
the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a
statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be 
challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable 
law, the arbitration will take place in Cobb, Georgia. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in 
court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on 
the award entered by the arbitrator.
{'\n'}
{'\n'}
If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in 
the state and federal courts located in Cobb, Georgia, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack 
of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.
Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer 
Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms.
{'\n'}
{'\n'}
In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to this app be commenced more than one (1) years 
after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect 
to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute 
shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree 
to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
</AboutText>
<TitleDetails>Restrictions</TitleDetails>
<AboutText>
The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent 
permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any 
Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or 
authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other 
persons.
</AboutText>
<TitleDetails>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</TitleDetails>
<AboutText>
The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal 
negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, 
any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, 
piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to 
be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this 
provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction 
within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
